# AoC day 08 star 2 - treetop scene score

# star 2 today is seen as impossible based on design of star 1:
# I assumed that a single digit is fine to store the (visibility, boolean)
# information. Now if part 2 will result in numbers >9, that needs a data
# structure of a real matrix then. 
# Success seen as too unlikely to try with old structure.
# Will let go star 2 and do this as a homework, probably in (num)py, later.
# good night.
